  data-selectable-paragraph="">本著這種精神，我不會嘗試對本書進行全面的觀察。相反，這篇文章提供了我閱讀材料時出現的公理列表，並進行了詳細闡述。這樣的結構是否適合“ listlist”綽號？我想是這樣。但是在這裡，格式可以滿足我們的需求。</p>
<p id="ef4d" class="ho hp ee hq b hr jj ht hu hv jk hx hy hz jl ib ic id jm if ig ih jn ij ik il dx fb"
  data-selectable-paragraph="">I once heard an agile coach announce that the most critical word in a product owner’s
  vocabulary is the word “no.” As in, “no, we’re not adding another feature right now. No, we’re not upgrading our
  coding libraries right now.”</p>
<p id="593f" class="ho hp ee hq b hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il dx fb"
  data-selectable-paragraph="">The word “no” exists to give focus to a company’s product development efforts.</p>
<p id="0fdc" class="ho hp ee hq b hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il dx fb"
  data-selectable-paragraph="">After reading van der Merwe’s book, I think he would agree. He advises companies to focus
  on their target market’s needs and goals and not chase technology fads or solutions that don’t fit the audience.
  Narrow the lens.</p>
<p id="b3be" class="ho hp ee hq b hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il dx fb"
  data-selectable-paragraph="">He backs up his advice with research showing that market-driven companies are 31% more
  profitable than those that are not.</p>
<p id="a75f" class="ho hp ee hq b hr jj ht hu hv jk hx hy hz jl ib ic id jm if ig ih jn ij ik il dx fb"
  data-selectable-paragraph="">It’s trendy these days to talk about T-shaped people. In essence, one should master a
  specialty (the vertical bar of the T) while knowing just enough from a smattering of related topics (the horizontal
  bar of the T). Combine depth with breadth.</p>
<p id="bce7" class="ho hp ee hq b hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il dx fb"
  data-selectable-paragraph=""><em class="im">Making it Right</em> gives the concept a different spin: Product managers
  should strive for the shape of a capital “I.” One can be visionary and flexible (the top bar) while also knowing
  details and how to deliver (the bottom bar).</p>
<p id="65fc" class="ho hp ee hq b hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il dx fb"
  data-selectable-paragraph="">I would take the idea further and argue that these two orientations are useful at
  different times in a project. Strategic thinking and defining a vision lend themselves to the earlier phases of
  designing a product, such as exploring user needs. Pragmatism and a bias for completion, on the other hand, are
  essential as deadlines loom and execution is a must.</p>
<p id="c0ed" class="ho hp ee hq b hr jj ht hu hv jk hx hy hz jl ib ic id jm if ig ih jn ij ik il dx fb"
  data-selectable-paragraph="">Consensus isn’t necessarily harmful, according to van der Merwe. But making it the
  primary goal of a design process often leads to diluted, boring products. Endless compromise wears down the original
  idea and demoralizes teams.</p>
<p id="9ea9" class="ho hp ee hq b hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il dx fb"
  data-selectable-paragraph="">Collaboration, on the other hand, preserves a clear vision. Everyone gets a voice, but
  decisions remain within the product manager’s purview. Not everyone will agree. But as long as they trust the
  decision-maker, they won’t mind.</p>
<p id="85bf" class="ho hp ee hq b hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il dx fb"
  data-selectable-paragraph="">For this approach to work, the author points out that management must establish a
  company-wide understanding that the product manager calls the shots. If executives don’t develop that vision, product
  managers can become powerless and frustrated.</p>
<p id="d5af" class="ho hp ee hq b hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il dx fb"
  data-selectable-paragraph="">I’ve noticed another problem with consensus-first cultures, which the book doesn’t cover:
  endless debate. If two people in a design discussion have strong opinions and stick to them, you might be there a
  while. I have seen these conversations drag on for weeks and still not end in agreement. A single person with the
  authority to adopt a solution — and who isn’t afraid to use it — can prevent such torture.</p>
<p id="071e" class="ho hp ee hq b hr jj ht hu hv jk hx hy hz jl ib ic id jm if ig ih jn ij ik il dx fb"
  data-selectable-paragraph=""><em class="im">Making it Right</em> points out the pitfalls of closed communication.
  Keeping loose research notes in a Word file on your laptop might be faster than curating a company wiki page. That
  easy road, however, keeps information away from teammates.</p>
<p id="4bb4" class="ho hp ee hq b hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il dx fb"
  data-selectable-paragraph="">Instead, work out in the open. If your documents might inform your colleagues’ thoughts
  and plans, make them available to everyone in your company at all times. Communication will likely improve since
  everyone will have the facts at their fingertips.</p>
<p id="5f6b" class="ho hp ee hq b hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il dx fb"
  data-selectable-paragraph="">Public documentation of findings, sketches, and plans has another benefit. The author
  didn’t discuss it, but that’s not surprising given his emphasis on the startup environment. When iterating on software
  products that have been around for a few years, there’s a natural tendency to forget the reasoning behind a particular
  design.</p>
<p id="d779" class="ho hp ee hq b hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il dx fb"
  data-selectable-paragraph="">Team members come and go. People move back and forth between projects. We shouldn’t
  assume the knowledge driving a decision today will be around in a few years when it’s time to iterate on an existing
  feature.</p>
<p id="b766" class="ho hp ee hq b hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il dx fb"
  data-selectable-paragraph="">Publishing your notes in a public space that is easy to find helps to ward off
  organizational forgetfulness. If new folks come on board a year from now, that’s okay. They can read the background
  documentation to understand why the product is the way it is.</p>
<p id="e4a0" class="ho hp ee hq b hr jj ht hu hv jk hx hy hz jl ib ic id jm if ig ih jn ij ik il dx fb"
  data-selectable-paragraph="">In business, saying that revenue can harm you is like saying up is down. But our author
  points out that dwindling income from a dying product can attach a company to an outdated offering, missing
  opportunities to catch bigger fish.</p>
<p id="b44e" class="ho hp ee hq b hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il dx fb"
  data-selectable-paragraph="">He tells how eBay had grown attached to charging a fee for allowing photos in its
  listings. The money was nice, but they didn’t realize that encouraging their customers to upload pictures would
  improve their platform’s rankings in search engines. When they finally switched to hosting photos for free, they lost
  a bit of secondary revenue. Still, they gained much more from the increased popularity of their core service.</p>
<p id="1b75" class="ho hp ee hq b hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il dx fb"
  data-selectable-paragraph="">The book boasts that the best way to solve the problem is to use research to demonstrate
  how much the firm stands to gain by cutting off the toxic revenue stream.</p>
<p id="a8f5" class="ho hp ee hq b hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il dx fb"
  data-selectable-paragraph="">Besides addiction to existing income, I think the sunk cost fallacy plays a role in this
  problem. Engineering organizations often pour a ton of resources into building products. Some employees might stake
  their reputations on them. A manager in that situation might try to salvage their project based on a personal survival
  instinct.</p>
<p id="3ff2" class="ho hp ee hq b hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il dx fb"
  data-selectable-paragraph="">Perhaps one way to avoid such clinging is to compliment people for building things well
  in the past, even if it isn’t the right thing to make anymore.</p>
<p id="40f3" class="kg kh ee ar ki kj kk kl km kn ko il fk" data-selectable-paragraph="">“If I had an hour to solve a
  problem, I’d spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions.” Albert Einstein</p>
<p id="6220" class="ho hp ee hq b hr kp ht hu hv kq hx hy hz kr ib ic id ks if ig ih kt ij ik il dx fb"
  data-selectable-paragraph="">Van der Merwe provides this quote to highlight a point: Tech folks often jump straight
  into crafting the solution.</p>
<p id="964e" class="ho hp ee hq b hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il dx fb"
  data-selectable-paragraph="">Take the famous phrase “minimum viable product,” for example. Our author takes issue with
  the word “viable.” Product managers typically use the term to describe the minimum set of features necessary to make a
  product work. The team should release the product once they reach that threshold.</p>
<p id="c439" class="ho hp ee hq b hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il dx fb"
  data-selectable-paragraph="">But “viable” does not mean “desirable.” Yes, the thing might work. But do people want it?
  Does it solve their problems?</p>
<p id="7f38" class="ho hp ee hq b hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il dx fb"
  data-selectable-paragraph="">Thus van der Merwe recommends the phrase “minimum desirable product” instead. The slight
  shift in emphasis calls attention to the user’s needs. If a product doesn’t fit its target market, then you have a
  well-crafted offering that no one wants. Thus we must take the time to frame the problem before solving it.</p>
<p id="3715" class="ho hp ee hq b hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il dx fb"
  data-selectable-paragraph="">I agree with the book here and suggest a root cause: developers typically master building
  things, not selling them.</p>
<p id="348f" class="ho hp ee hq b hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il dx fb"
  data-selectable-paragraph="">In my bachelor’s degree in computer science, I took a single course in studying users’
  needs. All other classes focused on programming. I’m not saying such strict emphasis on coding is inappropriate, just
  that it doesn’t teach developers much about the business side of their craft.</p>
<p id="0835" class="ho hp ee hq b hr jj ht hu hv jk hx hy hz jl ib ic id jm if ig ih jn ij ik il dx fb"
  data-selectable-paragraph="">A story is a time-honored medium for communicating, even in the tech industry. Agile
  folks know this from the omnipresent user story. <em class="im">Making it Right</em> shows us how to apply that
  principle to get across the essentials of a user’s problem.</p>
<p id="b6dc" class="ho hp ee hq b hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il dx fb"
  data-selectable-paragraph="">Enter the problem story: [user] has [problem] when [trigger]. Notice it doesn’t describe
  the solution like a user story does. Instead, it focuses on the need. The format concisely defines the target user,
  the problem to be solved, and under what circumstance the problem occurs.</p>
<p id="240b" class="ho hp ee hq b hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il dx fb"
  data-selectable-paragraph="">After presenting such a problem story, a product manager can provide enough of the
  problem’s context to guide the design.</p>
<p id="5f2b" class="ho hp ee hq b hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il dx fb"
  data-selectable-paragraph="">I like the problem story as an executive summary of a larger body of research. I’ve often
  written pages detailing customers and users’ needs, only to find that my colleagues haven’t read them. I’ve had more
  success when summarizing the essentials.</p>
<p id="ef17" class="ho hp ee hq b hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il dx fb"
  data-selectable-paragraph="">The source material, however, comes in handy when someone disputes my summary. Then,
  since the person is engaged, the opportunity has arrived to cover the topic in depth.</p>
<p id="478d" class="ho hp ee hq b hr jj ht hu hv jk hx hy hz jl ib ic id jm if ig ih jn ij ik il dx fb"
  data-selectable-paragraph="">I’m going to guess that just about everyone in the tech industry has at least heard of
  Agile, even if they’re not fully practicing it. The author cautions Agile practitioners to note that being nimble and
  iterative is not an excuse to stop planning or crafting a long-term vision.</p>
<p id="f83a" class="ho hp ee hq b hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il dx fb"
  data-selectable-paragraph="">Agile product managers must still select a target market and identify problems to solve.
  Products need a direction, even if that direction changes a bit from sprint to sprint as more information becomes
  available.</p>
<p id="7b18" class="ho hp ee hq b hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il dx fb"
  data-selectable-paragraph="">Furthermore, while Agile fosters iteration, it doesn’t provide for variation. When should
  we scrap a product or take it in a radically new direction? The Agile product owners’ toolkit — such as grooming the
  backlog and writing user stories — doesn’t answer these questions. Thus the traditional emphasis of product managers
  still has value here.</p>
<p id="544d" class="ho hp ee hq b hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il dx fb"
  data-selectable-paragraph="">As an Agile product owner myself, I agree that we should view the role as distinct from
  product management. Product ownership is more tactical, focusing on implementing a provided product strategy and
  explaining that implementation to development teams.</p>
<p id="c97c" class="ho hp ee hq b hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il dx fb"
  data-selectable-paragraph="">While a product owner can be the product manager, when she isn’t, she needs insight into
  the product’s vision to do her job well.</p>
<p id="eb85" class="ho hp ee hq b hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il dx fb"
  data-selectable-paragraph="">As I mentioned at the start, I’ve only covered a smattering of the insights in Rian van
